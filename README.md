# Bootstrap Responsive Portfolio

This is a personal bio/portfolio project with a focus on creating the web app to have a responsive design through the means of using Bootstrap. The intent is that the web app would adjust to properly display the web pages whether loaded on a full computer screen or a small mobile browser on a smartphone.
